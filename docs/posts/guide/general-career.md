## Introduction


## 1. Career Choices

I followed Software engineering path. Which I would recommend unless you have a passion for it, A passion for staying late-nights doing things that might not even correlate, like studying algorithms, researching into computers, working on projects and practicing your math.

- I have made into the career of software Development
  - I cant recommend it. No junior entries wanted only seniors with 5+ years of experience
- If you are new to this I would suggest a place like nurse or policeman or accounting.
- Or other blue collar jobs that are not able to neither be automized nor outsourced.
- Outsourceable/automated jobs: 
  - Software Development
  - Most other jobs including management.
  - What cannot be outsourced?
    - Talking. Jobs about talking.
    - Where it requires localiced certifications: Accounting, Engineering, Nursing, etc.
- Or social work like:
  - Maybe even teaching could be a good idea.
- If you are in an expensive higher education country such as: United States
	- Consider: (If you know Spanish) to apply for Argentinian Schools

As a general rule:
- Avoid careers that are not required to be in-person (e.g. can be outsourced )
- Avoid careers that are mind-numbingly boring (e.g. can be automated)
- Choose careers where a job in the position requires an local accreditation e.g. Accounting Accreditation, passing the engineering exam, law bar, etc.
- If you are lucky to feel passion about something (willing to work for free 16 hours a day) then choose it regardless of the bullets above.
  - Please test yourself within those guidelines, e.g. test the career for a month of 16 hours a day, if you are still willing to do it then go for it.
- Avoid 'studies' or too 'general' careers: 

- Its about finding a career and perhaps (location) in which you can pour your passion into it.

## 2. College Tips

- 1. Avoid non-science (or non hard) classes
	- Even if is a non-science class. Try to apply some kind of CS related simulation.
	- e.g. In my Anthropology Class I requested to perform a series of Genetic Algorithms Lab that also linked tied together my anthropology lectures.
- 2. Always do projects and struggle with the homework.
- 3. Create a portfolio of your projects
- 4. Create a memorization of the practice sets, to be done on the daily
- 5. Join Clubs and Be friendly, offer your services, always talk well, present good news.
- 6. Build a strong early-career, snowball and leverage such to meet people and make the *pact*. Whereas you promise each there of *recommending each other*. Attempt to target promising 3 students every week. Funnel-down and get those recommendations.
- 7. Take classes in parallel. e.g. Edx Micro masters or Khan Academy e.g. 
https://www.edx.org/masters/micromasters/ucsandiegox-algorithms-and-data-structures while studying data structures. Or TensorFlow while studying data science.
8. Cold message colleagues that are in the same industry and ask them to join you for lunch and talk.



The major problem is integrating them in an efficient manner, *Automatically.*
- How to integrate that as an habit? I would consider the study

**Projects**

For [6] I would suggest the following strategies:

- Definitively collect the user tags
- Organize conversation topics bubble project.
- Organize the target market, rate and score the leads. (race, school, advancing potential)

- You should aim, to do the same, even digitally. Just talk, and ask the::
- - What technologies are you more familiar, etc.
- And like, do you want to play some mini-games, do you have steam? Wanna try pubg?


## 3. Progressing your Portfolio

1. Make software Projects that can be shown to recruiters.
   1. Keep in readme the sets of Install options and descriptions with pictures and captures of it's features.
   2. Create a `highlight.md` file tracking the progression of your software and HIGHLIGHT whenever you face an interesting challanges.
2. Try to avoid repeating your stack.
3. Follow Industry best practices (Readmes\Namings) to make your respository look somehow legitimate.

## 4. Make Reusable Templates


1. Once you have a project done, don't let it stay like that, build a library/template out of it.
2. The entire project doesn't require to become a library, but aim to create a library from one of the complex parts of the project.
3. Checkout: 


## 5. Model Successful People on Your career

1. Not the louds ones, that got there by luck. Try to find those who worked hard. I know it might be cringy but model their approach as best as you can. Also if they are from a similar background, the better.
2. What certifications did they study? What projects they have built? What Habits did they accomplish?
3. In the case of software engineers: Focus or aim to build projects that serve as templates or libraries to show off your true mastery of the subject. _ This is almost as the equivalent of publishing the book of the topic for engineers.


## 6. Cracking the Role like a True Hacker.


*Approaching breaking into a company as approaching breaking as a Hacker*


Main Axions:
- Internal Department transfer > External Hires.
- Digital Anonym is bad, asking internally is good.
- Larger companies have many *hidden* entry positions.
- You can always be proactive and outgrow your role and interests.





































### 6. Crafting Masters and Curriculum Enhancement.

- The reality is that you just need the "masters" paper from an accredited enough sounding university.
- Then you show them your online curriculum you had been building and that's it.

Complete the Master of Science in Computer Science
### Master of Science in Computer Science (Wait Until is fully developed (it looks way more interesting))
https://www.coursera.org/degrees/ms-computer-science-boulder/admissions

And the on the side do the Masters of Science Data Science. Do all them unpaid. so you get the **knowledge** of two in 1.

https://www.coursera.org/degrees/master-of-science-data-science-boulder/academics

1 (max: 2)
1 
4
3 (max: 6)
Cost: 15k. Think around 1k worth of 3 credits value courses.

2 + 4 + 3 = 9 courses. Sounds alright to me.
- And you can max it to: 9 + 1 + 3 => 14 value courses.
- Compared to 10 Value Courses form most is enough
- You can show off your entire degree as the complicated science class.
- Take advantages of the email for hackathon events.
- Have a essential guidebook per course + 1 capstone project + 1 hour YouTube tutorial etc.

And then add some IT Support technicature:

- IBM IT Support Professional Certificate:
- [Google IT Support]()
- https://www.coursera.org/learn/content-marketing#modules

(You can literally add the Udemy + YouTube Projects to enrich your courses if you think about it.)
- You can even add Electronics
- JS Game Dev (For your supposed multimedia)
- The same for your supposed game dev.
