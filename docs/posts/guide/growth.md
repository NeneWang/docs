## 2. Have a Focusmate

- Use Focusmate to create a daily schedule
- Stick to it
- include Research about having an accountability partner


## 3. Use Current School Programs as an opportunity to make projects and deadlines.

- Always go beyond
- If it is too easy use it to learn more about the topic on your own.
- Always do the projects, and personal projects from what you have learned.
- Use the school as a way to create deadlines for your projects.


## 4. If you cant practice it, then you won't learn it



- Use tools like Anki
- Or show your custom tool
- Repetition is the mother of all learning
- Make it easy, dont make your practice writing a 250 words essay
- Is okay to make mistakes on practice, encourage it.
- Creating an habit or automating the practice schedule.


## 5. Reading is Great, But Practice is Better

- Being able to reach to practice is better than reading.
- Reading Serves well as a guide
- Video Lectures in some cases are better than books because is about how much can we get as inputs, and video lectures are more engaging.
- For Practical skills like programming, reading is not enough, we need to practice.
- You should even have the habit of creating flashcards using Anki or other tools from the books main points.




## 6. Hold Certifications for passive long-term practice

   1. Search common interview topics about it. 
   2. Or Certification problems with sample answers.
   3. Or Books with questions regarding it.
