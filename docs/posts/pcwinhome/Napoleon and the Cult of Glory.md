David Bell, Professor of History at Princeton, spoke on “Napoleon and the Cult of Glory.” 

- In this submission I will both summarize what was talked, but also add and contrast to personal similitudes and notes that I added while listening to the conversation. As I found it very interesting and useful to 
- The talk talked about the general story behind Napoleon bibliography. 
- The various descriptions and backgrounds. 
- What I want to focus on the essay, The takeaway is the propaganda craft of Napoleon and the idea of celebrity and cults. 
- To fight wars you require strong men to fascinate your soldiers. Heroes and leaders.
- Representation of the French Revolution movement
- Therefore this type of political hero would benefit from:
	- Being male, idea of masculinity
		- Objects of sexual envy.
	- This means soldier
		- Good at war
		- Figures of glory at combat
	- Ability to start countries
		- Someone who rules but has a concern of his people.
		- A parent figure that cares of the citizens as his own
	- Someone between the ordinary people
		- Doesn't matter his noble origins but his meritocracy at war.
		- No need to be distinguish lineage
		- Willingness to get dirty.
- Manipulation of propaganda
		- While he did his fair share of propaganda movements, there is merit on his actions. And there is no propaganda if there is not a willing listener
	- Printing of his figure in mass production in households, pots, houhold paintings,  etc.
		- We can see a common pattern also in communistic leaders: Mao Zedong in every Chinese yen
	- Quality Painting Propagandas and idealizations as we know today of the many paintings of Napoleon.
- Similarly we try to find celebrities in today modern society
	- Celebrities have to be:
		- Masculine's. Sexual envy
		- Have a triumphant characteristic: not necessarily physically.
- How being willing to make his hand dirty.
	- Napoleon and the stories that would circulate among his men tell:
		- How he was easy going and willing to work with his men
		- How he was seen loading the battle cannons thus their men started to jokingly refer to him as "The little corporal"
	- Chinese Hero, Guan Dong, Where wife gets sad at she hears that his son poison wound was cleaned by his general.
	- The King

- How it connects:
	- Napoleon is an allegory, but an example of this role behind many civilization leaders. As we study Imperialism, and Revolution I believe something that also moves people is the figures  
	- Ideas are too abstract to be taken to the masses, while many might start feeling it, to take it to the masses a figure head is an medium for it. From reading the reading assignment: Jules Ferry on the Civilizing Mission: "Jules Ferry on French Colonial Expansion, 1884" we an see the raising sentiment for the growth of the sentiment, and the excuse from French that they are finding in favor of expansion, such as the "duty to expand civilization" and to "protect French interests" Napoleon becomes the embodiment of this raising sentiment. Becoming and playing the role of the Hero of this ideology.
	- Empires needs their military heroes to move the masses of man in uniform to perform their ideals.
		- Empires don't govern along with power
		- Also with the soft power of 'strongmen'
	- Rome had Cesar
	- Nazis had Hitter
		- Experience military WWI
		- Meritocracy: Success at turning germanies economy around.
		- Willingness to get his hand dirty at the movements
- Personal Opinion: It seems from history that this pattern of man seems to be perhaps an exploit that people can intentionally exploit to make themselves gain loyal followers. And this can be exploited in modern society
	- This is useful. If you are ever looking at starting a business. Understanding the laws of leaderships and loyalty.
	- We are likely wired for this as human, nakes.
		- Recount experience with movies.
	- In today business world we tend to find our "business heroes" instead.
		- Elon Musk
		- Jensen Huang
		- Donald Trump
