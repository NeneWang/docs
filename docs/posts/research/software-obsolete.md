### To-do's

- [x] Research about art, and how other non-art products are treated, what are examples of non-art products which utility value lasts over generations?
	- [x] What's the discipline that is being implemented by their craftsman's

Thus, around 11:49 I would expect the last Obsidian Event to be sent.


Here some conversational topics. This is the idea or track of what I am hoping to achieve. Auto ecosystems. How to build that?

Even better than that. Not just surviving but maintaining or increasing their value over time? How to craft something that the more time is alive the more value is added into it? How to automate the ecosystem?

- Imagine the following:
	- An AI that gathers the memories of the past and future.
	- Here a few line of products that would be applicable to the idea of something which values increases over time:
		- Fictional:
			- An AI that keeps track of user personalities
			- An Autodocumention about Biology by recording videos and automated studies.
		- Existent:
			- Youtube
			- Wikipedia
			- Pandas/Popular Libraries
			- Linux
			- GitHub

Why does the following happen? in Youtube and Wikipedia?
- User content, people keep adding them into the projects.
- But then, they require a lot of maintenance
- Is there a project in which that doesn't happen?
- You also have Pandas and other Popular Libraries in which given that they are open source receive human-contributions thus growing in functionalities and stability over time.

The idea of Automatic dictates the following:
- At least, preserve the value over time.
- For a code-related project this means:
	- Keep an active documentation.
	- Keep an 

### A Dedication to a craft.

It is. Therefore, in my opinion that there is a limited amount of projects, one can limit one-self into maintaining.

I should be expecting as well an update hopefully?

Or does it not register whenever 

Here the following axioms:
- One has but a limited timeframe of work.
- Learning new stacks might mean loss of time and expertise
- Some projects are worth more in the sense of professional value
- Some other projects are worth more in the sense of Personal Passion.

Since I would be working with that for a while.



### Communicating.

- It might be an ineffectiveness in communication.
	- The documentation might be correct
	- But perhaps a meeting would make sense to really clear any doubts.
	- And there is no doubt that he is a very talented developer.
