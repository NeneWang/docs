What are they interested in?
- Interested in Audience? 
- Interested in Finding artists? What does the position say?


We are looking for self-motivated interns to:

• assist in the production of our online art shows and performances
• create strategies to bring more artist participation and to expand audience attendance
• research the online art community to forge collaborations with other agencies
• collect data on audience participation
• research and assist in Personaland's expansion into “Personaverse” VR/AR/XR projects
• work with other crew members to achieve successful outcomes
• communicating and coordinating the marketing crew Interns will gain skills in setting up and monitoring assignments using SMART goals.

Interns will be working with crew and artists from around the globe and will hone their ability to communicate. Listen and collaborate with team members to achieve positive and worthy goals. This is a remote internship so interns must have solid computer skills and access to a Wifi network when necessary.

We are looking for self-motivated, out-of-the box thinkers who can work well with others. Interns who aren't afraid the learn something new, grow their skill set, push the envelope. We need people who are people oriented and want to make a difference in the community.

Being remote, Interns can also accomplish their tasks on their own schedule. We might have deadlines to meet and we will have to coordinate a time where all can meet via Zoom for a weekly gathering to share progress and challenges.

Pitch, 




Hi I am a senior majoring in Computer Science:

- I am very involved in Student campus, mainly as a developer, some of my works can be seen:
- I am passionate about developing software that can be useful and help organizations expand their audience using Computer Sicence.
- Because I try to solve problmes in a meaningful way I am involved at my school, and participate contributing my skills for example
  - Student Leadership Website: e.g If you search in Koppelman Student Leadership Council we are first. This is a website built using React and compile into react.
  - And for the Financial Club I was in charge of developing a trading simulation platform for the Investment club, and they successfully at the moment completed 4 competitions, in the last competition with more than 100 active players.
  - I explored the site that you guys have, and I really liking how . 
- Additionally My aspirations also as a develooper is to get better at 3d Web Frameworks and Game Development which I think can be beneficial for the company
  - I did also spend a lot of time working with 2D frameworks such as Phaser and I think this experiecnce can help your site by having more complex silly games. 
  - I know that it says 20 hours, work limit, but between you and I am more than happy and available to work for more, as I try to build my best work, and putting in more hours help me as a developer and I think if I am able to work at your companies I would be also getting
  - I have some experience using Unity and developing 3d games, and this comes great because I was actually planning to spend my summer developing e-learning gmaes


Followup:

- Hi sorry that the ocnnection broke off
- Interested in working with..

Prevalence = P/P + N	Positive predictive value (PPV), precision = TP/PP = 1 − FDR
Accuracy (ACC) = TP + TN/P + N	False discovery rate (FDR) = FP/PP = 1 − PPV
Balanced accuracy (BA) = TPR + TNR/2	F1 score = 2 PPV × TPR/PPV + TPR = 2 TP/2 TP + FP + FN

### Approach:


- Here the game will be positing about the different reseaches and familiarity working with professors working on reports and experimentations:
- RecommenderS Systems: 
  - I didnt write this on my resume yet because they are kind of in progress, as I am working with professors for my honors projects
  - https://hackmd.io/@n_1IfOpxQPSjyRrn5yedJw/HkhYoMYfC
  - when you go to amazon
  - For example Matrix Fctorization; SVD: Singular value decomposition
  - Wordvec to ultimately find this things. 
  - Evlauting the models, calculating Acracy, Precision, F1 scores. 
  - Exploring ways inwhich this the different recommender could be combined
- Genetic Algortihms: With my professor in Anthropology Where I am exploring through genetic simulations social dynamics.
  - For example here I am testing 
  - https://hackmd.io/@n_1IfOpxQPSjyRrn5yedJw/r1fbS-RZC
  - And as you may have guess this is kind of the foundamentals 
  - For example here you have the different distribution of alleleles. and you can see how 
  - I havent made a process yet: t

  - https://snip.mathpix.com/wangnelson2/notes/cisc-3225-final-project-21c5669d-cdb2-4880-b166-59a9339b4414
  - Here I validating hypothesis through significance testing using methods such as Pearson Correlation Coefficient:, T Tests,
  - Linear Regression
  - Clustering to find both users that are alike, and 
  - Something interesting that came out was the activity. 
  - Also reducing the computing size and tried different ways such as paralelle computing for this. Since the dataset was enourmaous
  - Also trying via different Unsupervised machine learning algorithms to find clusters in the population
- Aligns with my interests of learning more about how to work on labs: 
- I would love to follow up with these reports
- I know that these resources are not I am happy to commit more time in order to be able to contribute.

Here are some formulas for calculating accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score:
Accuracy
Accuracy is calculated as TP + TN / P + N, where TP is true positive, TN is true negative, and P + N is the total number of labels.
F1 score
F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, calculated as 2 * Precision * Recall / (Precision + Recall). F1 score is a more reliable metric than accuracy score when comparing imbalanced classes, and is used when both false positive and false negative values are equally critical. 


The other one being from the robotics one this is more of a teaching position:



That was at a Charter School: Nuasin Next Generation Charter School


- The problem with Chromebooks
- So I had this site learn. https://learn.wangnelson.xyz/
- Where I had coding assigments, you could compile Java and Python Code, labs, assigment trackings, and interactive otebook
- It was a very fun experience, and I hoping I coud get also in the future as well.
