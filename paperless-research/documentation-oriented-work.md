#learning-tec


abstract
- How to maximize learning?
- Document on a `jounral`
		- Habits that forces reading documentation by linking documentation in journal
- Reference to the real documentation.
	- You can get assistance from reading partial solutions but expect to link documentation into documentation
- Create Practice Problems for algorithmic implementations.
	- Allow reference to documentation -> into cards
	- Use `journal` as a way to summarize the problem.
	- Reference to the obsidian page.
- 

Context: 
- Projects includes: learning mini projects/exercises
- In this paper I will be looking up into 


### Documenting Libraries/Frameworks



### Markdown like Problems

Design Heuristics
- The objective is not to memorize, but to practice the implementation.
- Not adding useless problems ideally - and focus on practicing the practical implementations of ideas. so is more like a append nearby while you go idea.

- Reading documentation alone is likely useless.
	- You want to practice by knowing how to use this ideas and which situations which means



Examples of what goes in:
- Interesting implementations of arguments to solve specific problems.
- Implementing mathematical models / algorithms / Pseudocodes / Quickly plotting things.
	- Such as creating your own implementation of RMSE
	- Or own theorical neural network.


Structure

Ideally group 2, but up to 3 items.
